#BobTracker

A course project mobile application developed with a few classmates in Android Studio.
The purpose of BobTracker is to track a user's fitness journey and help them achieve their goals by using a points system.
When a user is working out, they will start a timer and earn points that are used in a shop for rewards. 
Users can customize a schedule to workout with notifications to remind them of when they should do a workout.
